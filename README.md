- 🕸️ Web developer, specialized in frontend
- 📖 Open source fan
- 🎓 PhD in Memology

I like to see the full picture and I'm not afraid to try new things, which leads me to the point where I can handle a whole project on my own, from idea, through  design, frontend and backend code, automation pipelines, hosting, to analytics tools.

While I wouldn't consider myself as a full-stack developer, this set of skills let me to be a glue between teams, let me easier create company processes, design project architectures and improve developer tools.
