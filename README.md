### Hi there 👋

🕸️ Web developer, specialized in frontend.

📖 Open source fan. 

🎓 PhD in Memology.

I like to see the full picture and I'm not afraid to try new things, which leads me to the point where I can handle a whole project on my own, from idea, through  design, frontend and backend code, automation pipelines, hosting, to analytics tools.

While I wouldn't consider myself as a full-stack developer, this set of skills let me to be a glue between teams, let me easier create company processes, design project architectures and improve developer tools.

### Bio
I started doing web when I was 15yo, customizing and converting some PSD to HTML + CSS for local business 🤓

In 2012 did my first serious project, [SCADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) app admin panel for steering sewage pump stations / treatment plants. It looks like I was doing PWA, before it ever exist 😎, because it was a build on purpose instead of native mobile apps.

After giving college a quick, one year, try (or maybe the opposite 😅), I stared working full time on various Ruby on Rails based projects, mostly startups and ecommerce, which learn me to write a lot of code in short time, once did 12k LoC in a week 🔥.

Since 2014 I'm working at [SNOW.DOG](https://snow.dog) an ecommerce specialized software house, started as a second frontend developer in company that have about 20 people, currently I'm a Head of Frontend with 14 people in my team and we have 70 people total.
